# Dissolving samples for Chlorine 36 analysis

This script simulates the effect of evaporation on final 35Cl-36Cl-37Cl ratios.

The output looks like this:

This shows that adding half of your spike before and half after dissolution minimises the effect of evaporation on the final 36Cl/Cl and 35Cl/37Cl ratios.
